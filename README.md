###Exercise

The quotes are all hardcoded in our web page.  Let's start moving towards having a dynamic web application and set the existing quotes programatically via Javascript.

- Create an array of the existing quotes, each quote having text and author √
- Add the quotes to the page dynamically with JavaScript

Further:
- Extend our quote application so that a user can add quotes. √

Even Further:
- Add functionality to delete quotes
- Style page √ (not **real style** as I mean it, just to make it kind of 'colourful')

Even Even Further:
- While typing show the quote being created at real time.
